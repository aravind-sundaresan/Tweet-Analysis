# Tweet-Analysis
​This is a Business Suite for the Analysis of Event‐based Tweets. ​  The project is used for the analysis of tweets obtained from a particular event or  expo hosted recently.  This data can be used by companies to see where their products  (launched at the event) stand among the users in terms of popularity. This is done by performing a sentiment analysis on the tweets pertaining to a particular product.

In this case the event considered is the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2015 held in Barcelona.
